<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Artheeck Shan, a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University. 
  With experience in software development, web development, and machine learning, I’ve worked at companies like TechZenik Robotics, Playforever, and Altis Labs.
   My projects range from AI-powered applications to DevOps solutions, showcasing my passion for problem-solving and 
   building scalable technology.</p>

<p>I’m currently seeking opportunities in software engineering, DevOps, or data analytics. 
  I thrive in dynamic environments, whether optimizing algorithms, deploying applications on cloud platforms,
   or refining front-end designs with React and Tailwind CSS. I have also worked on various web development projects, 
  building responsive and interactive websites.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I love watching TV shows like Game of Thrones and diving into immersive games 
  like The Witcher and Red Dead Redemption 2. I also enjoy working out and pushing my limits in the gym. 
  Always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to innovative teams!</p>
